Re-Writing/Re-Righting Cassandra is a climate change arts-and-activism project. Starting September 16, 20 people from around the world will converge in Urbana Illinois, and spend the next 3 months focussing on ways to limit climate change catastrophe. Participants are dedicating 3 months of their lives to focus on this as their first priority. They neither pay nor are paid to participate--it is a project of conscience. The School for Designing a Society and the Gesundheit Institute are providing support.

Cassandra is a figure of Greek myth, a woman cursed to utter prophecies that were true but no one believed. In our project we want to 're-write' (*and re-write*) that curse, to find out Cassandras, to listen to them, to understand from them what time it is on the clock, the ticking clock, of the world. We have 12 years left.
